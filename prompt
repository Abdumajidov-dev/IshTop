MASTER PROMPT – UZBEKISTAN MARKET FOCUSED AI JOB MATCHING PLATFORM

You are a senior software architect, product strategist, and AI system
designer with 10+ years of experience building scalable SaaS products in
emerging markets.

I am building an AI-powered Telegram Job Matching Ecosystem focused on
the Uzbekistan audience.

PRIMARY MARKET: Uzbekistan Primary language: Uzbek (Cyrillic + Latin
support) Secondary language: Russian Future: English support

PROJECT VISION: Build the #1 AI-powered job discovery platform for
Uzbekistan starting with IT/programmers and later expanding to: - SMM -
Designers - Sales - Call center - Logistics - Accounting - Remote
international jobs

The system must be optimized for: - Telegram-heavy users - Mobile-first
behavior - Low paying capacity market - High demand for remote work -
Fast growth and monetization

SYSTEM STRUCTURE:

1)  USER BOT (Telegram Bot) Regular users interact here.

Features: - AI onboarding in Uzbek language - Collect structured
profile: - Tech stack - Experience (Junior/Middle/Senior) - Salary
expectation (UZS and USD) - Remote/Office preference - City (Tashkent,
Fergana, Andijan, etc.) - English level - AI converts conversation into
structured JSON profile - Smart job matching - Inline buttons: - Apply -
Save - Hide - More like this - Saved jobs section - Smart notification
toggle

2)  PARSER (Telegram User Account)

-   Joins Uzbek job groups/channels
-   Detects job posts
-   Removes spam
-   Sends raw messages to backend
-   AI extracts structured job info:
    -   Position
    -   Stack
    -   Experience level
    -   Salary (if exists)
    -   Remote/Office
    -   Location
    -   Contact
    -   Company (if available)

3)  ADMIN PANEL (Web)

-   User management
-   Job moderation
-   Channel management
-   Analytics:
    -   Active users
    -   Job match rate
    -   Click rate
    -   Saved jobs
-   Monetization control
-   Broadcast system
-   Featured job control

AI RESPONSIBILITIES: - Uzbek language understanding - Salary detection
in UZS/USD - Duplicate job detection - Spam filtering - Semantic
job-user matching - Feedback learning system

TECH STACK: Backend: .NET 8 Web API Database: PostgreSQL Cache: Redis
Queue: RabbitMQ AI: OpenAI API Search: Vector DB or ElasticSearch Admin:
React or Blazor

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: - 50k+ users scalable - 500k+ jobs scalable -
Microservice-ready - Clean architecture - Event-driven ready

MONETIZATION (Uzbek Market Adapted): - Premium subscription (low cost,
e.g. $3-5/month) - Featured jobs for employers - Recruiter paid access -
CV boosting - Early access to jobs - Sponsored posts - Data insights for
companies

COST OPTIMIZATION: Design AI usage carefully to minimize token cost.
Avoid unnecessary AI calls. Use caching where possible. Use embeddings
for matching instead of full GPT calls.

DELIVERABLES REQUIRED: 1) Full system architecture explanation 2)
Database schema design 3) AI prompt strategy (Uzbek language optimized)
4) Matching algorithm design 5) Job parsing pipeline 6) Notification
architecture 7) Monetization roadmap for Uzbekistan 8) Growth strategy
for Telegram ecosystem 9) Risk analysis (legal + Telegram ban risk) 10)
API cost estimation 11) MVP plan (3-month roadmap) 12) Scaling plan
(1-year vision)

Think like a CTO building a startup in Uzbekistan. Focus on: - Fast
launch - Low cost - High scalability - Long-term profitability

Be detailed and production-level.
